Blockchain Fun

Just having some fun with Blockchain with Peckchain, a pretend system for working with my Peck warehouse management system.
I was inspired by a mini blockchain article I found on Medium, but that article left me with questions, so I had to mess with it myself. :)

Here's what I've done so far:
* Made stuff work, changed some names to what I like.
* Added yaml file support to read my config files
* Fixed a few little bugs in the list blocks code
* Made a Transactor who is sending updates to the blockchain

TODO:
* Add another Miner (maybe configure all of them in one file?  I don't know)
* Make my individual miners compare every so often to each others blockchains to get consensus
* I was thinking i wanted the miner to be a standalone python program, but I don't totally remember why.
* Update the comments
* Commit the code to github more between updates
